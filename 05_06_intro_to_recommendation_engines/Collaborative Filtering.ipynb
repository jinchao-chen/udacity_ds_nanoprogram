    "## Recommendations with MovieTweetings: Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular methods for making recommendations is **collaborative filtering**.  In collaborative filtering, you are using the collaboration of user-item recommendations to assist in making new recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main methods of performing collaborative filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering**, which is based on the idea that we can either correlate items that are similar to provide recommendations or we can correlate users to one another to provide recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Based Collaborative Filtering**, which is based on the idea that we can use machine learning and other mathematical models to understand the relationships that exist amongst items and users to predict ratings and provide ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will be working on performing **neighborhood-based collaborative filtering**.  There are two main methods for performing collaborative filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User-based collaborative filtering:** In this type of recommendation, users related to the user you would like to make recommendations for are used to create a recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Item-based collaborative filtering:** In this type of recommendation, first you need to find the items that are most related to each other item (based on similar ratings).  Then you can use the ratings of an individual on those similar items to understand if a user will like the new item.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will be implementing **user-based collaborative filtering**.  However, it is easy to extend this approach to make recommendations using **item-based collaborative filtering**.  First, let's read in our data and necessary libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Because of the size of the datasets, some of your code cells here will take a while to execute, so be patient!"

    "### Measures of Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "When using **neighborhood** based collaborative filtering, it is important to understand how to measure the similarity of users or items to one another.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways in which we might measure the similarity between two vectors (which might be two users or two items).  In this notebook, we will look specifically at two measures used to compare vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pearson's correlation coefficient**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson's correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship. The value for this coefficient is a value between -1 and 1 where -1 indicates a strong, negative linear relationship and 1 indicates a strong, positive linear relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two vectors x and y, we can define the correlation between the vectors as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CORR(x, y) = \\frac{\\text{COV}(x, y)}{\\text{STDEV}(x)\\text{ }\\text{STDEV}(y)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{STDEV}(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{COV}(x, y) = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where n is the length of the vector, which must be the same for both x and y and $\\bar{x}$ is the mean of the observations in the vector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the correlation coefficient to indicate how alike two vectors are to one another, where the closer to 1 the coefficient, the more alike the vectors are to one another.  There are some potential downsides to using this metric as a measure of similarity.  You will see some of these throughout this workbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Euclidean distance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean distance is a measure of the straightline distance from one vector to another.  Because this is a measure of distance, larger values are an indication that two vectors are different from one another (which is different than Pearson's correlation coefficient).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the euclidean distance between two vectors x and y is measured as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{EUCL}(x, y) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - y_i)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from the correlation coefficient, no scaling is performed in the denominator.  Therefore, you need to make sure all of your data are on the same scale when using this metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Because measuring similarity is often based on looking at the distance between vectors, it is important in these cases to scale your data or to have all data be in the same scale.  If some measures are on a 5 point scale, while others are on a 100 point scale, you are likely to have non-optimal results due to the difference in variability of your features.  In this case, we will not need to scale data because they are all on a 10 point scale, but it is always something to keep in mind!\n",
    "\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### User-Item Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the similarities, it is common to put values in a matrix.  In this matrix, users are identified by each row, and items are represented by columns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/userxitem.png \"User Item Matrix\")\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In the above matrix, you can see that **User 1** and **User 2** both used **Item 1**, and **User 2**, **User 3**, and **User 4** all used **Item 2**.  However, there are also a large number of missing values in the matrix for users who haven't used a particular item.  A matrix with many missing values (like the one above) is considered **sparse**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first goal for this notebook is to create the above matrix with the **reviews** dataset.  However, instead of 1 values in each cell, you should have the actual rating.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The users will indicate the rows, and the movies will exist across the columns. To create the user-item matrix, we only need the first three columns of the **reviews** dataframe, which you can see by running the cell below."
