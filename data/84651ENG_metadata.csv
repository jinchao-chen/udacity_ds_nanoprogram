1. GENERAL INFORMATION

This table contains data on total vehicle kilometres of goods vehicles in the Netherlands (broken down by Dutch and foreign vehicles) and data of total kilometres and average annual kilometres of Dutch goods vehicles (broken down by Dutch and foreign territory).
All figures are further broken down by lorries and road tractors, by years of construction of the vehicle and by gross vehicle weight. 

Data available from: 2001

Status of the figures:
Definite data are available for 2001 to 2016, and provisional data for 2017 and 2018.

Changes as of 12 november 2019
None, this is a new table.

When will new figures become available?
New figures will be published on a yearly basis in November of the subsequent year.


2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS

Definitions:

Vehicle-kilometre
Unit of measurement for traffic, representing the movement of a vehicle over one kilometre.

Average annual kilometres
The average number of kilometres per year travelled by a vehicle.

Goods vehicle
Lorry or road tractor, delivery van is not included.

Lorry (road tractor not included)
Rigid heavy goods road vehicle with a gross vehicle weight above 3500 kg, exclusively or primarily designed to carry goods.

Road tractor
Road motor vehicle, exclusively or primarily designed to haul other road vehicles which are not power-driven (mainly semi-trailers). 
Agricultural tractors not included.

Year of construction
The year of the first registration of the road vehicle, irrespective of the country of registration.

Gross vehicle weight (GVW)
Gross vehicle weight (legally permissible maximum weight). Total of the weight of the vehicle (or combination of vehicles), including its load when stationary and ready for the road declared permissible by the competent authority of the country of registration. 

Explanation of symbols:

Empty cell : figure not applicable
. : figure is unknown, insufficiently reliable or confidential
* : provisional figure 
** : revised provisional figure

Figures are rounded off to the nearest 100,000 kilometres. Consequently, the sum of the detail data can deviate from the total.

Explanation of abbreviations frequently used in this table:
NAP = Stichting Nationale AutoPas (National Car Pass)
PTI = Periodic Technical Inspection (APK = Algemene periodieke keuring)
RDW = Dienst Wegverkeer (the Netherlands Vehicle Authority)

4. SOURCES AND METHODS

It has become illegal to reverse the odometer or to advertise about that. This obligation applies to personal vehicles and light company vehicles (up to 3,500 kg). Odometer readings have to be registered more often in order to reduce the chance of fraud. 
Next to the PTI-inspection, odometer readings for vehicles up to 3,500 kg are also registered by change of car ownership, inclusion in company stock, demolition of a car, by importing or exporting a vehicle, repairs over 150 Euros and installation of an LPG tank or an alcohol interlock. The registration of odometer readings of heavy commercial vehicles occurs after the PTI.

The survey method for this table can be found in the survey description <a href='https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/methoden/onderzoeksomschrijvingen/korte-onderzoeksbeschrijvingen/verkeersprestaties-vrachtauto-s-en-trekkers'>Verkeersprestaties vrachtauto's en trekkers</a> (only available in Dutch language).

- lorries and road tractors which are used part of the year on the Dutch public road system, e.g. new or imported vehicles and vehicles which are scrapped or exported during the year.

The calculated figures are higher than the number of registered lorries and road tractor units on the reference date 1 January, as published in the tables on the motor vehicle fleet. 
Goods vehicles in use are all vehicles which could have been used during the entire year. The motor vehicle fleet only includes all motor vehicles with valid registration numbers on 1 January. Therefore, the actual number of motor vehicles is smaller.
